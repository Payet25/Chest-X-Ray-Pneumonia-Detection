This project implements a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images for detecting pneumonia. Using a dataset of labeled X-ray images, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between healthy lungs and pneumonia-affected lungs with high accuracy. The project aims to demonstrate the power of AI in supporting medical diagnosis and to encourage further exploration of deep learning applications in healthcare.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilizes the publicly available Chest X-Ray Dataset.
Model Architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Augmentation: Incorporates techniques to enhance model generalizability.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve analysis.
Visualization: Includes Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight regions contributing to predictions.
